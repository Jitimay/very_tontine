## 🎯 Demo Narrative

### **Act 1: The Problem** (30 seconds)
> "In Africa, *millions* of people use 'Tontines' - informal savings circles where friends contribute weekly and take turns receiving the pot. But they're **cash-based, risky, and hard to trust** at scale. What if we could put this on-chain?"

### **Act 2: The Solution** (30 seconds)
> "VeryTontine brings savings circles to VeryChat. A **smart contract acts as the treasurer** - no human can touch the funds. Contributions are enforced, payouts are automatic, and defaulters lose trust score."
