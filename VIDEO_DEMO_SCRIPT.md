## 💡 Director's Tips:
1.  **Speed**: Keep your mouse movements smooth. Don't rush the clicks.
2.  **Sound**: Record in a quiet room. If you can't record your voice, use a high-quality AI voiceover.
3.  **Proof**: Keep the **[VeryScan Explorer](https://veryscan.io/address/0xA3012C011643B8a726c7B322D8aFC52a0Bc679d2)** in a secondary tab to quickly "prove" the live on-chain events if needed.
4.  **Edit**: Use a tool like Loom or Descript to trim out the "waiting for transaction" gaps (usually 2-3 seconds).
